[C11][A100][Nrobo-dude}]...Oh?
[A111]Ooohh!!
You’re here!
You’re actually here!
[A110]…*ahem*
Thank you for responding to our call for help.
[A111]We knew you were a bad enough dude for the job!
[A110]What’s the job, exactly…?
Well, you see…
[A111]It’s all of them!
Everything!
The whole land is rife all sorts of problems!
[A110]Sounds like a lot, huh?
Like a huge responsibility that you couldn’t even possibly begin to handle, right?
[A111]Don’t worry! That’s why all the land’s top scientists and engineers have graciously and voluntarily* worked many long hours to give you this...
[C21][C10][E]The Ultra A.I.™!
Check out that slick controller design!
Now all the confusion and uncertainty that comes with delicately navigating any given problematic situation--
--from jumping from one platform to the next, to knowing just the right words to say to ease the shattered heart of a young child grieving their murdered parents--
--is gone!
[C20][C11][A110]All you have to do is move the Ultra A.I.™ to the problem you want to solve, and press this obnoxiously big and unmissable button!
Our A.I. friend here will then determine just the right action for the situation, and perform it! It’s that simple!
[A111]No more guesswork! The Ultra A.I.™ hasn’t failed us once!
Even the most questionable of its actions eventually turned out to have had purpose!
[C10][A110]How about you give it a try? Go over to that ledge there and see what our A.I. buddy can do!
===02===
[C11][A111][Nrobo-dude}]Wow! What a jump!
So effortless! So cool!
The problem of the ledge being in the way was no problem at all for the Ultra A.I.™!
[C10][C31]Now see what it does when you try it out on that nice boy over there!
===03===
[C11][A111][Nrobo-dude}]How sweet!
[A110]The Ultra A.I.™ is a friend to all.
[A111]Anyone would be thrilled to have their problems solved by the Ultra A.I.™!
[A110]Even the problem of having the hankering for a good ol' butt-scratch.
[C10][C41]How about you get the hang of things by navigating the Ultra A.I.™ over to me at the other side of this strange and seemingly purposeless structure.
===04===
[C11][A111][Nrobo-dude}]Lookin' good!
[A110]Now you're ready to go out into the world and start solving problems!
I'll take you to your first assignment!
[A111]Let's gooooooooo!
===05===
[C11][A111][Nrobo-dude}]Wow! So diligent!
[A110]You helped every one of my stinky babies...
[A111]You truly are the hero we so desperately need!
[A110]Anyway, now you're ready to go out into the world and start solving problems!
[A111]I'll take you to your first assignment!
Let's gooooooooo!
===20===
[C11][A110]...
No...
We were too late...
It's all gone.
There's nothing left...
Not a single soul...

Was there a method to its madness?
Maybe it was a desperate ritual, necessary for staving off some kind of unknown horror.
Maybe the AI had found its true calling.
Maybe it was just a glitch in the algorithm.
We’ll never know.
It continued dancing for the rest of eternity, even as the village burned around it.
